# Tutorials on Multi-output Gaussian Process for mortality modeling 

In this page, we provide a sequence of tutorials on how to implement Multi-output Gaussian Process (MOGP) Regression for simultaneously modeling mortality rates in multiple populations. All the datasets used in this study are publicly available on the Human Mortality Database and the implementation was done in R.
